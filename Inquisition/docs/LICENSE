Java.Inquisition is free software; more specifically, I've released Java.Inquisition
into the public domain. In effect, this is like a perfectly free, non-copyleft licence.
For example, you may:

* redistribute the work;
* create and distribute a derivative work;
* translate the work and distribute the translation;
* combine the work with other works and distribute the result;
* aggregate the work in a distribution with other works;
* whatever you like.

It is ''requested'' that you give credit for this work if you reuse it, 
and that you offer any derivative works to other people in the same spirit as 
this work was offered to you: with as few conditions as possible (preferably 
no conditions), and access to the source code. These above request cannot be
 enforced legally; they are not requirements. It is essentially an ethical 
decision, and you will have to decide for yourself.

==Libraries==
Java.Inquisition uses JDOM and a modified version of jhighlight as 
external libraries. JDOM is available under an Apache-style license with the acknowledgement
clause removed[http://www.jdom.org/docs/faq.html#a0030].
jhighlight is available under the the common development and distribution license (CDDL), v1.0;
or the GNU Lesser General Public License, v2.1 or later. See the copyright terms for those individual
files.
