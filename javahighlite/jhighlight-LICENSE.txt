I've made customisations to JHighlight so that it can be used as a Java.Inquisition highlighter.

Thanks for downloading JHighlight!

JHighlight has been developed by Uwyn bvba/sprl (http://uwyn.com) with gracious source code donations of Omnicore Software (http://www.omnicore.com) that enabled the core structure and the initial lexers.

JHighlight is an embeddable pure Java syntax highlighting library that supports Java, Groovy, C++, HTML, XHTML, XML and LZX languages and outputs to XHTML. It also supports RIFE (http://rifers.org) templates tags and highlights them clearly so that you can easily identify the difference between your RIFE markup and the actual marked up source.

The javadocs contain details information about how to customize, execute and integrate JHighlight.

On the commandline, you should call it like this (on one line):

java com.uwyn.jhighlight.JHighlight [--verbose] [--fragment]
                                    [-d destdir] file|dir ...
--verbose   Output messages about what the parser is doing.
--fragment  Output fragments instead of complete documents.
-d          Specify the destination directory

Have fun!
